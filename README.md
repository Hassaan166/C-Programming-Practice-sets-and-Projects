## C Programming Practice Repository

Welcome to my C programming practice repository! This repository contains practice sets and projects for learning C programming, organized by chapters. Each chapter includes multiple problems that I have worked on to enhance my skills.

## Repository Structure

- Chapter Folders: Each folder is named according to the chapter number and contains source files for that chapterâ€™s practice set. The folder structure is as follows:
  - Chapter0/ - Practice Set for Chapter 0
  - Chapter1/ - Practice Set for Chapter 1
  - Chapter2/ - Practice Set for Chapter 2
  - Chapter3/ - Practice Set for Chapter 3
  - Chapter4/ - Practice Set for Chapter 4
  - Chapter5/ - Practice Set for Chapter 5
  - Chapter6/ - Practice Set for Chapter 6
  - Chapter7/ - Practice Set for Chapter 7
  - Chapter8/ - Practice Set for Chapter 8
  - Chapter9/ - Practice Set for Chapter 9
  - Chapter10/ - Practice Set for Chapter 10
  - Chapter11/ - Practice Set for Chapter 11

- Source Files: Each C source file is named in the format `CXPY`, where `X` is the chapter number and `Y` is the problem number. For example, `C1P1.c` refers to the first problem in Chapter 1.

- Comments: Each source file begins with a comment block at the top, containing the problem statement for that specific exercise.

## Projects

In addition to the practice sets, this repository includes two projects:
- Project 1: NUMBER GUESSING GAME.
- Project 2: SNAKE, WATER, GUN.

## Progress

Currently, the following chapters and projects are completed:
- Chapters: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
- Projects: Project 1

As I progress through the course, I will continue to add completed chapters and projects to this repository.
